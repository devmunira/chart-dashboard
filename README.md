# Dynamic Dashboard Project README

### 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Dynamic Dashboard project! This document provides a comprehensive outline of the software requirements for a coding challenge focused on creating a dynamic dashboard using React, Highcharts for charting, and React-Grid-Layout for layout management. As a developer, My aim is to understand and fulfill these requirements to successfully deliver the project.

### 2. Project Objectives
As a developer, My primary objective is to build a dynamic dashboard that allows users to interact with different chart types within a flexible layout. The key project objectives are as follows:

- Develop a React-based dynamic dashboard.
- Integrate Highcharts to render various chart types.
- Implement a responsive layout system using React-Grid-Layout.
- Create functional chart components that can be resized, dragged, and dropped.
- Develop a settings menu for customizing chart types and titles.
- Implement state management to enable dynamic chart and layout updates.
